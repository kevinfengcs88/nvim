# My Neovim Config
This repository contains my Neovim config, which is written in Lua. It uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for managing plugins.

## work in progress...

- add trouble back with no toggle (just to be able to see long LSP error messages)

## Uninstalling

I build Neovim from source. To uninstall just run:

```
rm -f $(which nvim)
```
